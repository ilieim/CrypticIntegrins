The folders include the Gromacs input files used for each protein and concentration.
The "ClusterAnalysis" subfolder contains the input files for the clustering analysis performed with Campari (https://campari.sourceforge.net). Prior to the analysis, the trajectories should be aligned and stripped of solvent molecules.
The virtual screening was performed with SEED (https://github.com/clangi/SEED) and the required input files are provided.
